Created a Machine Learning Model which takes in  few movie names as input an gives out a list of recommended movies for the users.

Have you ever wondered how Netflix recommends you movies to watch? 
or How Spotify reccomends you songs?

It turns out that there are three types of recommendations possible. Let's see what they are.

Three popular recommendation systems:

Popularity based recommendation :
A very good example of this is the "trending list" that you see on Netflix. It keeps a view count of the movies being watched and displays them in decreasing order of their view counts.

Content based recommendation:
This type of recommendation systems, takes in a movie that a user currently likes as input. Then it analyzes the contents (rating , overview, genre, cast, director etc.) of the movie to find out other movies which have similar content. Then it ranks similar movies according to their similarity scores and recommends the most relevant movies to the user.

Collaborative filtering based recommendation:
This algorithm at first tries to find similar users based on their activities and preferences.
